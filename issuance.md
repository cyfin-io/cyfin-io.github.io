<p> Whenever an economic relationship begins, the underlying asset and the rules of exchange have to be defined. CyFin proposes crypto-conditions for this negotiation. Two approaches are possible:
  <ul>
    <li>Upon payment, the issuer can create a crypto-condition of a specific value to the paying customer. When the crypto-condition is claimed by the customer the amount stated in the condition is added to his account balance.<br><br></li>
    <li>The issuer can create an open crypto-condition, claimable by anyone. Open conditions can be put as digital downloads into an online store, or behind a payment wall. The Buyer can complete the condition with his account address and claim the balance.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
