# Issuance of Credit

Whenever an economic relationship begins, the underlying asset and the rules of exchange have to be defined. CyFin proposes crypto-conditions for this negotiation. Two approaches are possible:

- Upon payment, the issuer can create a crypto-condition of a specific value to the paying customer. When the crypto-condition is claimed by the customer the amount stated in the condition is added to his account balance.
- The issuer can create an open crypto-condition, claimable by anyone. Open conditions can be put as digital downloads into an online store, or behind a payment wall. The customer can complete the condition with his account address and claim the balance.

Once the customer has a balance, he is ready to sign crypto-conditions and submit fulfillments with each API request.

# Metering of Consumption

CyFin provides APIs to validate crypto-conditions and payment-channels to agregate them. Check our [API documentation](https://github.com/cyfin-io/account-lib/wiki) for details.
